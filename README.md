Project Description: Analyzing Performance Metrics for Atliq Grand Hotel Chain

Atliq Grand, a reputable hotel, operates in multiple cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru. The chain offers a diverse range of hotel types to cater to various guest preferences, 
including Atliq Seasons, Atliq Exotica, Atliq Bay, and Atliq Palace. Each hotel type serves distinct purposes, with Atliq Palace embodying luxury and Atliq Seasons catering primarily to business travelers.

Within each hotel type, guests can choose from a selection of room categories, including Standard, Elite, Premium, and Presidential, each offering different amenities and price points.

Booking accommodations at Atliq Grand hotels is convenient and accessible through multiple platforms. Guests can make reservations directly through the Atliq website, which is owned and managed by Atliq Brands. 
Additionally, third-party booking sites such as MakeMyTrip, Goibibo, and TripAdvisor provide alternative avenues for booking. Offline bookings are also accommodated to cater to guests' diverse preferences and 
accessibility.

The objective of this data analytics project is to leverage available data to extract actionable insights regarding the performance of different room types, preferred booking platforms, 
and overall room occupancy trends. By analyzing historical booking data, we aim to identify patterns and trends that can inform strategic decision-making for Atliq Grand.

Key areas of analysis include:

1)Room Type Performance: Assessing the occupancy rates and revenue generation for each room type (Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential) across different hotel types to determine which categories perform the best.

2)Booking Platform Preference: Analyzing booking patterns to understand which platforms (Atliq website, third-party sites, offline bookings) are most commonly used by guests when making reservations.

3)Room Category Performance: Evaluating the performance of different room categories within each hotel type to identify trends in guest preferences and demand.

By gaining insights into these key metrics, Atliq Grand can optimize its operations, marketing strategies, and customer experience initiatives to better meet the needs and preferences of its guests, ultimately
driving enhanced performance and profitability across its hotel portfolio.
